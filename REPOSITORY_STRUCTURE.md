# HologramFire Repository Structure

## 🏗️ Clean, Organized Architecture

This repository has been reorganized following the principle of "less is more" with clear separation of concerns and logical grouping.

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### **1. Clear Separation of Concerns**
- **`core/`**: All main system logic and source code
- **`libs/`**: External libraries and SDK implementations
- **`data/`**: All data, schemas, and fixtures
- **`docs/`**: Documentation and examples
- **`tools/`**: Development and deployment utilities
- **`experiments/`**: Experimental and prototype features

### **2. Eliminated Redundancy**
- Consolidated duplicate SDK implementations
- Merged scattered documentation
- Unified data storage locations
- Removed duplicate configuration files

### **3. Logical Grouping**
- All source code in `core/src/`
- All tests in `core/tests/`
- All configuration in `core/config/`
- All tools and scripts in `tools/`
- All documentation in `docs/`

### **4. Consistent Naming**
- All directories use kebab-case
- Clear, descriptive names
- No abbreviations or cryptic names

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Easier Navigation**: Developers can quickly find what they need
2. **Better Maintainability**: Clear structure makes updates easier
3. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Less clutter, more focus
4. **Improved Onboarding**: New developers understand the structure immediately
5. **Cleaner CI/CD**: Build and deployment scripts are organized

## 📋 Updated Configuration

All configuration files have been updated to reflect the new structure:
- `package.json`: Updated all script paths
- `Makefile`: Updated build and test paths
- TypeScript configs: Updated source and output paths

## 🔧 Usage

The reorganized structure maintains full backward compatibility while providing a much cleaner development experience. All existing functionality remains intact, just better organized.

---

**Result**: A professional, maintainable repository structure that follows industry best practices and makes the codebase more accessible to developers.
