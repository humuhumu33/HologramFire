## Gap Resolution Summary

### ✅ **Database Dependency Tracking**
- **Before**: Missing database dependency tracking
- **After**: Comprehensive database dependency tracking with schema discovery, performance monitoring, and dependency graph generation

### ✅ **Infrastructure as Code Integration**
- **Before**: Missing infrastructure-as-code integration
- **After**: Full IaC support with deployment orchestration, compliance checking, and cost analysis

### ✅ **Enhanced Networking System**
- **Before**: Basic networking (bridge, CTP-96 placeholder)
- **After**: Advanced networking with topology management, CTP-96 sessions, security policies, and performance monitoring

### ✅ **Extended Storage Systems**
- **Before**: Limited storage systems (volumes, but no database integration)
- **After**: Comprehensive storage management with database integration, backup management, and replication support

## UOR Framework Alignment

### Single Context Resolution
All infrastructure components are now unified under the UOR framework:
- Each component has a unique UOR-ID
- Cross-modal dependencies are tracked
- Holographic fingerprints ensure integrity
- Witness signatures provide verification

### Modality Bridging
The implementation bridges multiple infrastructure modalities:
- **Containers**: Through IaC and orchestration
- **CI/Workflows**: Through deployment management
- **Documentation**: Through metadata and schemas
- **Deployments**: Through orchestration and monitoring
- **Databases**: Through dependency tracking and integration
- **Networking**: Through topology and session management
- **Storage**: Through system and volume management

### Virtualized Types Support
The system now supports the base components of information systems:
- **Users**: Through application components and dependencies
- **User Interfaces/Operating Systems**: Through application components
- **Storage**: Through comprehensive storage management
- **Networking**: Through enhanced network management
- **Policy**: Through compliance and security policies
- **Pipelines**: Through deployment and orchestration

## Integration Example

See `src/infrastructure/InfrastructureIntegrationExample.ts` for a complete example demonstrating:
- Setting up infrastructure components
- Creating cross-modal dependencies
- Deploying infrastructure
- UOR resolution
- Health monitoring
- Dependency graph generation

## Usage

```typescript
import { InfrastructureIntegrationExample } from './src/infrastructure/InfrastructureIntegrationExample';

// Run the complete example
const example = new InfrastructureIntegrationExample();
await example.runExample();
await example.cleanup();
```

## Benefits

1. **Unified Infrastructure Management**: All infrastructure components are now managed under a single UOR context
2. **Cross-Modal Dependencies**: Dependencies between different infrastructure modalities are tracked and managed
3. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Health and performance monitoring across all infrastructure components
4. **Compliance and Security**: Built-in compliance checking and security policy management
5. **Cost Optimization**: Cost analysis and optimization across infrastructure components
6. **Disaster Recovery**: Automated backup and replication management
7. **Single Context Resolution**: All infrastructure components can be resolved through the UOR framework

## Future Enhancements
